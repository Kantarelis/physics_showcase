# physics_showcase
This repository contains various calculations and visualizations I personally made during my studies in Computational Solid Physics. I did not make a presentation which is at an academic level on purpose. This is, as the name suggests, only a showcase. If you actually interested in these stuff and want to now more, please contact me on linkedIn. I'll try to help during my free time.
